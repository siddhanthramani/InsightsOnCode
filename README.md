# insightsoncode
We help B2B software businesses understand their customers, their product and track customer-product fit. 

Insightsoncode can 
1. help you understand how each customer uses your product. 
2. help you understand your product better and analyze product performance - both from a time and cost perspective
3. help you understand how your customers use your features/products in aggregate and validate customer-product fit

<br>
We log 6 different information to gain insights (CPE-NBC Framework).

1. On the customer(C) - to understand who is using your service

2. On the product(P) - to understand which product is being used
    1. On the node(N) - to understand which node of product is being used (frontend/backend/etc.)
    2. On the branch(B) - to understand which version of product is being used
    3. On the code(C) - to understand which parts of the code should be optimized

3. On the customer-product fit (endpoint,E) - to understand how/why your product is being used

Note : Code tracking involves tracking execution time and cost (if cost information is available). This can be used to optimize time-cost efficiency of your product.
